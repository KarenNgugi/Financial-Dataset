# Financial-Dataset Project

The following files were added
 * "Financial Dataset -1 (2).csv" - this contains the original data set
 * "Financial Dataset.ipynb" - this is my own Python notebook on what I've attempted
 * "VariableDefinitions (1).csv" - this contains the descriptions of the columns in the original dataset
 * "W2 IP.docx"- this contains the full detailed overview of the problem statement, links to the datasets, and links to more information on the surveys conducted per country. It also contains the rubric which provides guidelines on how to go about the project
